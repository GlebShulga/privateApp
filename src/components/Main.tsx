            I&apos;m a Full Stack developer with a primary focus on{" "}
            <strong>React</strong> and <strong>NodeJS</strong>, and I enjoy
            creating things that live on the Internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my career, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work on a variety
            of exciting projects that have helped me hone my skills and gain
            valuable experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            My area of expertise as a Full Stack developer lies in optimizing
            website performance and improving user experience. Through various
            projects, I have honed my skills in optimizing Webpack bundle sizes,
            resulting in faster page load times and improved website
            performance. My commitment to accessibility is strong, and I have
            conducted audits and adaptations for e-commerce platforms to ensure
            A11y compliance, making websites more accessible for users with
            disabilities.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            In addition to my front-end expertise, I have built robust and
            scalable RESTful APIs using Express and Node. One of my major
            accomplishments as a Full Stack developer was building and launching
            an enterprise-level React application from scratch. The application
            received positive feedback from both stakeholders and end-users,
            demonstrating my ability to create successful solutions that meet
            the needs of all parties involved.

            Interested in both frontend and backend development and working on
            ambitious projects with collaborative and supportive teams.
