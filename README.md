This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How to quickly try it?

ðŸ‘‰ The project is hosted on Github pages: https://glebshulga.github.io/privateApp

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

or

yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/cv](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/cv.tsx`.

The `pages` directory is mapped to `/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
